# Games
As a passionate programmer, I've combined my love for coding and gaming to create a variety of interactive games using Python. Each project has allowed me to apply my skills in problem-solving, game design, and programming logic, while also expanding my knowledge of Python libraries like Pygame.

Here are some of the games Iâ€™ve developed:
<h3>1. Snake</h3>
Experience the classic Snake game, made using Python and the pygame library! In this fun and addictive game, you control a snake as it slithers around the screen, trying to eat food that appears randomly. Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the score increases. But beware, if the snake crashes into the walls or itself, it's game over!
